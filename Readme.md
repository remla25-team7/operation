## Assignment Progress Log

### Assignment A1

* **Model-Training**: Created the ML training pipeline using a Hugging Face model.
* **Model-Service**: Containerized the ML model with Docker and exposed it via a Flask REST API; added a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the container.
* **Lib-ML**: Standardized preprocessing in a PyPI package, shared by both training and model-service components.
* **Lib-Version**: Built a version checker for the app service.
* **App**: Dockerized web application using HTML/BootstrapÂ 5 for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
* **Operation**: Central repository for deployment configurations, featuring Docker Compose and detailed README instructions.

### Assignment A2

#### Prerequisites

* **Vagrant** & **VirtualBox** installed
* **AnsibleÂ 2.18+** on host (or use the bundled Vagrant provisioner)
* OS user with privileges to edit `/etc/hosts`

#### 1. Clone & Spin Up

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo-dir>
vagrant up --provision
```

This will:

1. Boot the **ctrl**, **node-1**, and **node-2** VMs
2. Run Ansible to install Kubernetes, containerd, MetalLB, nginx-ingress, and the Kubernetes Dashboard

#### 2. Point `dashboard.local` at the Load Balancer IP

Add the following line to your hostâ€™s `/etc/hosts`:

```text
192.168.56.95   dashboard.local
```

#### 3. Browse the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:

```text
https://dashboard.local/
```

#### 4. Log in as Admin

Retrieve your token on the control VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh ctrl
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user
```
