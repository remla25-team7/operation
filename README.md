## Assignment Progress Log

### Assignment A1

- **Model-Training**

  - Created the ML training pipeline using a Hugging Face model.

- **Model-Service**

  - Containerized the ML model with Docker and exposed it via a Flask REST API.
  - Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and publish the container.

- **Lib-ML**

  - Standardized preprocessing in a PyPI package used by both training and the model service.

- **Lib-Version**

  - Built a version-checker utility for the app service.

- **App**

  - Developed a Dockerized web application using HTML/Bootstrap 5 (frontend) and Flask (backend).

- **Operation**

  - Centralized deployment configurations in this repository, featuring Docker Compose and detailed README instructions.

### Assignment A2

#### Prerequisites

- **Vagrant** & **VirtualBox** installed
- **Ansible 2.18+** on host (or use the bundled Vagrant provisioner)
- Host OS user must be able to edit `/etc/hosts`

#### 1. Clone & Spin Up

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo-dir>
vagrant up --provision
```

#### 2. Load kubeconfig to all your terminal sessions

Depending on what terminal you are using:
if you are using zsh or

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

or if you are using bash.

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Copy the full path of the file named kubeconfig in this repository.
Then paste this line at the end of your .bashrc/.zshrc: export KUBECONFIG=path/to/your/operation/kubeconfig

#### 3. Obtain access token

kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user

##### 3.1 Kubernetes Dashboard port-forwarding

Run the Kubernetes Dashboard and paste the token in the browser to login.

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard-kong-proxy 8443:443
```
Kubernetes can be accessed through http://localhost:8443

### Assignment 3

### 1. Installing Prometheus with Helm

To install the Prometheus kube-prometheus-stack chart from the `prometheus-community` repository, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts && \
helm repo update && \
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

### 2. Navigate to the Helm Chart Directory

```bash
cd helm/restaurant-sentiment
```

### 3. Install Prometheus Operator CRDs and install the Helm Chart

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusrules.yaml && \
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml && \
helm install sentiment .
```

### 4. Check that it Works and port-forward the app-service

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
kubectl get ingress
kubectl port-forward svc/sentiment-app 5001:5001
```

App-service can be accessed through http://localhost:5001
App-service metrics can be accessed through http://localhost:5001/metrics

---

### 6. Access Prometheus UI locally

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090
```
Prometheus can be accessed through http://localhost:9090

You can also test Prometheus alert running this command:

```bash
while true; do curl -s http://localhost:5001/ > /dev/null; done
```

### 7. Debuging

If a new image is pulled and you want to rerun the helm run these commands:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment app
cd helm/restaurant-sentiment
kubectl helm upgrade sentiment .
```

---

### 8. Creating and Acessing Grafana


Run the following line to start Grafana Dashboard

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
```

Grafana Dashboard can be accessed through http://localhost:3000

Admin login username and password:

Username: Admin
Password: prom-operator

The dashboard should be visible under the name "Restaurant Sentiment Dashboard"

If a new image is pulled and you want to rerun the grafana, run these commands:
